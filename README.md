# HLib
Hardware library from Department of Computer Engineering, HCMUT (for more information, follow this link: https://www.cse.hcmut.edu.vn/~bvhieu/index.php/hlib-project )

The aim of this project is to build up an eco-system for applying embedded system into real world. The eco-system includes an open hardware library, an open software library, and a community of engineers, researchers, and students.

The most important point that makes this project differ others is standardization. The project standardizes connector interface, connector layout, and board mechanical specification. All hardware designs have to comply with these specifications in order to form a compatible hardware library. In addition, a standardized software library are developed concurrently. This ensures every board can plug and play. Consequently, users using HLib only think about their applications and add-in value. They do not need concert with hardware design, hardware compatible, hardware abstract layer any more. Is it amazing idea of HLib.

The hardware library includes some mother boards (MBoard) and vast of extension boards (divided into stackable board, SBoard, and end board, EBoard). MBoard is main board with primary micro-controller or micro-processor. It connects all boards together and takes responsibility as master controller of whole system. MBoards are pre-developed by a core developer team. SBoard and EBoard provides extension, specific functions such as wireless communication, motor control, high precision analog-to-digital converter, etc. SBoard can stack multi-layer while EBoard cannot. SBoard and EBoard are developed and integrated into the HLib by developer community or anyone who want to contribute.

In first phase, main purpose of the project is to support developing of embedded system in Department of Computer Engineering, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (DCE-HCMUT). Basis MBoards, EBoards and their software libraries are designed by lecturers and students of DCE-HCMUT. These boards are used in students' projects, thesis, and researches freely in laboratory. DCE will corporate with companies to make special discount program so that student can own these boards. They can also make these board by themselves with open hardware provided. Lecturers may use these board for fast prototype in their projects also. For more information about developing plan, please click here

The core developer team select ARM architecture for MBoard. ARM has strong computation, lot of peripheral, and low power consumption. In our vision, it will replace 8-bit and 16-bit MCU/MPU and become universal MCU/MPU in near future.

The project is open. All the hardwares and softwares of HLib are open access. Using, developing, commercializing, or getting profit form HLib must complying with NonCommercial-ShareAlike Common Creative License

The project is started by a group of young people in Department of Computer Engineering, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology . We always welcome new members join.

We make a better life together
